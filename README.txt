Sprint Review and Retrospective

How can I interpret the needs of users and use it as a program? How to create a "user story"?

 I interpret the needs of users by dividing them into smaller, clear requirements. Creating a user story helps because it focuses on what the user actually wants instead of only the technical details. Each story shows the value to users, which then guides development decisions and keeps the user at the center of the project.

How can I approach the development program? What processes do I hope to combine in my future development?

 I approach program development by working in small pieces that can be managed and improved over time. Agile processes such as planning, running sprints, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives allow work to stay organized and adaptable. In the future, I hope to use the Agile method more because it lets me respond quickly and deliver value step by step instead of waiting until the very end.

Being a good team member in the development of software means what?

Being a good team member means a clear communication, sharing progress and supporting others when challenges occur. It also means the opening of suggestions and flexibility with changes. Strong team members help create an environment in which everyone can succeed and the project can move forward smoothly.
